Project done as part of the subject of algorithms and data structures. Made in the C language. 
STL in particular was strictly prohibited. The final version is located in the directory ,,vector''.

The main goal of this project is to convert an ordinary arithmetic operation into postfix form and then calculate it 
showing the subsequent steps. These operations also contain complex functions such as MIN, MAX which can have
an unlimited number of arguments, or the IF function which has only 3 arguments.

I got a 90% mark.
